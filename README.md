# UPTEC Lunch

It's a simple API, built in Flask, to get the UPTEC cafeteria menu for the week and return it ready for a Slack command.

# Installation

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To run

`python server.py`

# HTTP GET Filters

`text=today`, will give the today's menu instead of the week menu

# Next features

I'm developing some filters...
